# ADHD
A super mini projectâ€”a productivity app that I made with Tkinter to improve my productivity while I'm behind my screen, reading, or coding.
It helps me stay focused and on track.
I would really love to expand it more and add more things to it.

It takes a different approach from the traditional Pomodoro technique, q different way to manage focus and breaks.
